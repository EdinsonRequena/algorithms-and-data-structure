# Algorithms And Data Structure

### Algorithm

````
"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, 
computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to 
perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous  and are used as specifications 
for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks." - Wikipedia

### Data Structure

```
"In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management,
and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More 
precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships 
among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data." - Wikipedia
