### Algorithm

````
" In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, 
computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to 
perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous  and are used as specifications for performing 
calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. " - Wikipedia
